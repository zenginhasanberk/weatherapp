# React Native Weather App

This is a React Native app that shows the weather at your current location. It uses the expo-location module (part of Expo SDK) to get user's current location.
It then uses user's coordinates to make a request to the free weather API, Open-Meteo. All of the information is displayed on the main page.
The user can also view their current location on the map in a separate view.
